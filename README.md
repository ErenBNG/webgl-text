## Getting Started

First if you don't have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) you should download it for using NPM. 

Then go into your IDE and open terminal. Type:
cd webgl-text
# and
npm install

When it is installed succesfully go into your terminal and run your server by writing:
npm run dev

And it should start and open server automatically.
If it doesn't open the server in your browser the LocalHost server should be written on your terminal.
